Mock Twin Study Project
=======================

This repo is a collection of R scripts designed to simulate some twin data, run some basic twin study analyses on them.

The scripts contain all the code necessary to simualte the data, and run the analyses yourself.

This project serves primarily as a showcase of my techical abilities regarding coding, statistics and analysis.

Modelling
---------

### Phase 1 ###

1. Research Questions

- Can I competently simulate twin data for the purposes of running some interesting Twin Models using Structural Equation Modelling?
- Can I write clearly and efficiently written executable R scripts to demonstrate the above?
- Can I learn something interesting about Twin analyses by simulating multiple varieties of data - different correlations, different data types and distributions?

2. Define the design, design the study

- Simulate Twin data including:
  - Multiple phenotypes
  - Age and Sex to be used as covariates
  - 2 siblings
  - Data with Sex, and sex limited effects
- Store in 1ID per line, and 1Family per line data types

3. Variable Selection

- Multiple, simulated variables designed to generate interesting and interpretable results and improve my understanding of:
  - SEM
  - AIC statistics
  - the effects of a variety of distributions and variable types on Uni and Multivariate Twin Analyses
  - the effects of sample size and model selection on results
  - power requirements for different structural equation models and variable types

4. Analysis Plan

- Simulate twin data
  - Perform assumption testing of data
- Meticulously record my process, results, and understanding along the way
- Keep the repo updated on GitHub

5. Calculate sample size estimations (Power calculation)

### Phase 2 ###

6. Data collection and cleaning

7. Further cleaning - create new variables etc.

8. Test Assumptions

9. Run univariate and bivariate statistics 
  - basic data analysis and visualization, histograms, boxplots, basic summaries and relationships

10. Run your initial model

### Phase 3 ###

11. Refine predictors and check model fit

12. Check for and resolve data issues

13. Interpretation of results

14. Write up

What an awesome Experimental run sheet. I can use this to break down all my steps and make the whole thing much clearer.

End.
