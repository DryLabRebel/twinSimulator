Mock Twin Study Project
=======================

This repo is a collection of R scripts designed to simulate some twin data, run some basic twin study analyses on them.

The scripts contain all the code necessary to simualte the data, and run the analyses yourself.

This project serves primarily as a showcase of my techical abilities regarding coding, statistics and analysis.

Modelling
---------

### Phase 1 ###

*Check* (14-05-2021) - - Can I simulate twin data
*Check* (14-05-2021) - - Can I write executable R scripts
- Can modify the script to accept input? Maybe turn the simulation into a function?

- Simulate twin data
  - Perform assumption testing of data
- Meticulously record my process, results, and understanding along the way
- Keep the repo updated on GitHub

5. Calculate sample size estimations (Power calculation)

### Phase 2 ###

6. Data collection and cleaning

7. Further cleaning - create new variables etc.

8. Test Assumptions

9. Run univariate and bivariate statistics 
  - basic data analysis and visualization, histograms, boxplots, basic summaries and relationships

10. Run your initial model

### Phase 3 ###

11. Refine predictors and check model fit

12. Check for and resolve data issues

13. Interpretation of results

14. Write up

What an awesome Experimental run sheet. I can use this to break down all my steps and make the whole thing much clearer.

End.
