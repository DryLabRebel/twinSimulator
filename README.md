Twin Simulator
==============

A portfolio project.

A very simple R script which randomly generates correlated data.

Command line executable, accepts two arguments which designate the correlation between two pairs of variables,
which you can think of the monozygotic (identical twin) and dizygotic (non identical twin) pair correlations
respectively.

*Check* (14-05-2021) - - Can I simulate twin data

*Check* (14-05-2021) - - Can I write executable R scripts

*Check* (15-05-2021) - - Can modify the script to accept input

*Check* (19-05-2021) - - Can I designate default values when input is missing

- Can I name arugments for input

Can I tidy up the simulated data, and save it a dataframe? (\*.txt)

NOTE: Don't forget you need to commit changes on a branch before switching branches, otherwise your changes
carry over to the switched branch!
